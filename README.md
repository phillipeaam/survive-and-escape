## A little about the game

I'm passionate about game programming, and I took it as a challenge to learn more about the C++ programming language and [raylib](https://www.raylib.com).

This game is the first attempt to create everything from scratch using only these two technologies, and it was super FUN! I've learned a ton! Also, I got myself doing my best to reach the final line alive! Hahaha!

In short, you're a kitten who's gotten stuck in a "puzzle cave" and now is doing your best to survive and escape it. There's a counter to remind you how many fails you've done until you reached your goal, and it gets reset when you succeed.

_**Play the game to check for yourself the features in action. Have fun! =D**_
